### Architecture

![Architecture](/.images/architecture-data-collection-detailed.png)

1. [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) rule invokes [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) for every deployed data collection module based on schedule.
2. The Step Function launches a [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function **Account Collector** that assumes **Read Role** in the Management accounts and retrieves linked accounts list via [AWS Organizations API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html).
3. Step Functions launches **Data Collection Lambda** function for each collected Account.
4. Each data collection module Lambda function assumes an [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) role in linked accounts and retrieves respective optimization data via [AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html). Retrieved data is aggregated in an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.
5. Once data is stored in the S3 bucket, Step Functions trigger an [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) crawler which creates or updates the table in the [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/components-overview.html#data-catalog-intro).
6. Collected data is visualized with the [Cloud Intelligence Dashboards](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/advanced-cloud-observability-with-cloud-intelligence-dashboards-on-aws/) using [Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) to get optimization recommendations and insights.

### Deployment Overview

![Deployment Architecture](/.images/architecture-data-collection-deploy.png)

1. Deploy the Advanced Data Collection Permissions CloudFormation stack to Management (Payer) AWS Account. The Permissions CloudFormation stack in the Management (Payer) Account also deploys Permissions stacks to each of Linked accounts via StackSets.

2. Deploy the Data Collection Stack to the Data Collection AWS Account

## S3 Bucket Encryption Configuration

This module supports three encryption options for S3 buckets:

1. **S3-Managed Encryption (Default)** - Simplest option, no setup required
2. **Customer-Managed KMS Keys** - For compliance requirements, uses key aliases across regions
3. **External Management** - For advanced users with AWS Config automation

**[Read the Complete Encryption Guide](docs/ENCRYPTION.md)** for detailed configuration options and decision tree.

**Important:** If you plan to manage encryption outside CloudFormation, read the [Encryption Warning Guide](docs/ENCRYPTION_WARNING.md) first.

### Quick Start - Encryption Options

**Option 1: Default (Recommended for Most Users)**
```yaml
# No parameters needed - uses S3-managed encryption (AES256)
# This is the default behavior
```

**Option 2: Customer-Managed KMS Keys**
```yaml
Parameters:
  KMSKeyAlias: "my-key-alias"  # Same alias name in all regions
  ManageBucketEncryption: "yes"  # Default
```
Prerequisites: Create KMS keys with the same alias in each region. [See guide](docs/ENCRYPTION.md#option-2-kms-with-alias)

**Option 3: External Management (Advanced)**
```yaml
Parameters:
  ManageBucketEncryption: "no"  # CloudFormation will NOT manage encryption
  DataBucketsKmsKeysArns: "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abc-123,..."
```
**[Read warnings first](docs/ENCRYPTION_WARNING.md)** - You are responsible for ensuring buckets are encrypted.
